\chapter{Problem Definition and scope}

\section{Problem Definition}

The traditional paper-based case paper system employed in government hospitals across India presents several challenges in terms of accessibility, efficiency, and accuracy. These challenges include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Manual Data Entry:} The process of recording patient information, medical histories, diagnoses, prescriptions, and lab test results is labor-intensive and prone to errors, leading to inaccuracies in patient records.
    
    \item \textbf{Limited Accessibility:} Patient records stored in physical files are often inaccessible remotely, hindering healthcare providers' ability to access and update patient information efficiently.
    
    \item \textbf{Inefficient Patient Management:} The absence of a centralized system for managing patient records results in inefficiencies in patient registration, record updates, and case paper generation, leading to delays and confusion in healthcare delivery.
    
    \item \textbf{Data Security and Privacy Concerns:} Paper-based records are susceptible to loss, theft, or unauthorized access, compromising patient data security and privacy compliance.
    
    \item \textbf{Lack of Integration:} Fragmented systems for managing patient information, such as separate records for diagnosis, prescriptions, and lab test results, lead to disjointed workflows and hinder comprehensive patient care.
\end{enumerate}

To address these challenges, the HealthFlow Connect project aims to digitize the case paper system used in government hospitals in India. By leveraging modern technologies and best practices in software development, the project seeks to create a comprehensive digital platform for managing patient information and medical records effectively. The digital platform will streamline patient management processes, enhance accessibility to medical records, improve data accuracy, and ensure compliance with data security and privacy regulations.
